# A prelude to making an awesome toy project

This is my small and precious toy-project for an awesome project that even I don't know what happen yet.
In this repository I am going to do some exercises using Wep APIs provided by Spotify.

I don't know what kind of project will be made.
But it will make some harmonies and be cool.
That's why music and life are so wonderful! ðŸ¤£
